jcp2 usage
----------
To see the parameters available:
jcp2 or jcp2 -?


Known issues
------------
* After each memory Bank download, jcp2 -r must be performed otherwise Bank 2 may not be downloaded correctly
--- The problem is a legacy issue

* Display the libusb version used

jcp2 2.06.00 note

jcp packages history
--------------------
8 jcp source packages were found here and there, and hereafter a brief summary from the most recents

1) The Removers's package available at https://github.com/sbriais/skunk_jcp has been updated (13 Juin 2020)
-- It contains the fork from tursilion version and enable the Removers extensions.
-- jcp2 has integrated these extensions
2) The package available at https://github.com/tursilion/skunk_jcp can probably be considered as the latest / current "official" one (8th September 2018)
-- Work on jcp2 continued with this source code
3) The Removers jcp version, rmvjcp.tar.gz, doesn't handle the Skunkboard v3 (or at least they do not display options to handle it)
-- They have added support for the Skunk console communication, but it is unclear if such addition has been done in Tursi code as well
-- At a point, in 2012, The Removers stopped to update their jcp version and missed the changes/fixes done 6 months later by Tursi/A31Chris
4) The jcp version in the skunkboard.zip is the oldest jcp source code found
5) The Skunkboard_full_release.zip file was the container of the newest / most recent jcp source code releases (dated from the 12th August 2012)
-- Work on jcp2 started with this source code
6) The CJ version has been added in this history but this version looks to follow the tursi code before the jcp2 version done by Tursi
