To see the parameters available:
jcp2 or jcp2 -?


Known issues
------------
* After each memory Bank download, you have to do a jcp2 -r
-- If you don't, Bank 2 may not be downloaded correctly
--- The problem existed also in previous versions
* jcp2 connects to the first Jaguar is detect
-- You can change this behavior by using the -serial, -ubus and/or -uport parameters to connect to a specific Jaguar


jcp2 2.0.6 note
---------------
* Merging with the source code, 8th September 2018, from Tursilion
* Added the -ubus parameter

* Switch the project to Visual Studio 2017
* Added a communication timeout parameter
* Put back the Skunkboard firmware update

jcp History
-----------
7 jcp source packages were found here and there, and hereafter a brief summary

1) The Removers jcp version doesn't handle the Skunkboard v3 (or at least they do not display options to handle it)
-- They have added support for the Skunk console communication, but I do not know yet if such addition has been done in Tursi code as well
-- At a point, in 2012, The Removers stopped to update their jcp and missed the changes/fixes done 6 months later by Tursi/A31Chris
2) The jcp version in the skunkboard.zip is the oldest jcp source code I've found
3) The Skunkboard_full_release.zip file was the container of the newest / most recent jcp source code releases (dated from the 12th August 2012)
-- My work on jcp2 started with this source code
4) The package available at https://github.com/tursilion/skunk_jcp can probably be considered as the latest / current one (8th September 2018)
-- My work on jcp2 continued with this source code
5) The CJ version has been added in this history but this version looks to follow the tursi code before the jcp2 version done by Tursi
