--------------------
JCP2 release INSTALL
--------------------


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

The minimum requirements for compiling jcp2 from source are:

 o  LibUSB 0.1 or LibUSB 1.0.22
 o  Visual Studio 2017
 o  supported OS (Windows 32/64 bits)

Previously supported OS (Linux or OSX); other
OSs may work too but you may need to change the code and create a Makefile.

For Windows, the lib and header file are provided for LibUSB 0.1. 
For Linux or OSX, you must get these files yourself and set up LibUSB on your system correctly.
http://libusb.sourceforge.net/

The Makefile has to be done for people building under Linux or OSX.

No official support is given for user-built binaries, however, if you are stuck you
can always create an issue in the GitHub project.


NOTES FOR COMPILING UNDER VISUAL STUDIO 2017:
---------------------------------------------

Win-VS2017 sub-directories contain the project and solution files.
You may have to adapt such files to handle your own development environement,
usualy to put the right include and library paths will be enough assuming you have all the requirements properly set.

Assuming all went well, you will have either Debug or Release executables.
